## UFO sighting

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to use Javascript, Bootstrap and HTML to build a dynamic web application for UFO sightings that has filters based on the date, city, state, country and shape.

### Components
when the website is opened by the user will see a title followed by an image and then a small paragraph talking about the UFOs. If the user scrolls down the web application will show a table of sorted data and on the left of the page a set of differet filters where the user can filter by date, city, country, state and shape. The user can use one or more filters and the page will return the results that meet the search criteria entered in the filters by the user.

### Summary
After deploying the web application I found that the website is using a static data and will not be able to capture any future updated data. A great feature would be adding a script to scrape data from different websites and keeps the web application uptodate. I recomend improving the web application by adding more information like the number of people at the site and references showing the source of the data. I also recommend adding another filter for the darution.
